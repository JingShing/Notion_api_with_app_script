# Notion_api_with_app_script
A simple note for using notion api with app script.

# Why this repo created?
Recently I got a mission to write the code about notion api on google app script.

It is not a good experience reading notion api manual. Since it was update its syntax recently.(I totally ruined the OAuth2.0 on it, and wasted much of my time.)

In fact, It is a torture.

So, I wrote this repo to help someone like me to keep your time from this horrible api thing.

BTW, I think this time I am doing a great job on commnet in the code.

# Before started
* You may need a notion account.(from register or rent one.)
* You may need to create a integration from [notion developer](https://developers.notion.com/)
  * It will generate a ```integration token``` for you.(This is important, save it carefully)
  * And you need to give integration some of capabilities of writing, reading or inserting.(Depending on what you want to do)
